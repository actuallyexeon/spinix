# spinix
A unix-like kernel written in the Rust Language!

I'm also following a [tutorial](https://os.phil-opp.com/) if anybody wants to follow the same one.

>The name "`Spinix`" originates from my older attempt at writing a kernel named "`Spice Kernel`", a kernel made using [Philipp Oppermann's](https://github.com/phil-opp) [Rust kernel tutorial](https://os.phil-opp.com/). The term spice originates from MemorySpice, a Cheat Engine like rewrite in Rust, though it was never made due to the [winapi crate](https://crates.io/crates/winapi) being broken at the time. Ever since then I've decided to follow along with [Philipp Oppermann's](https://github.com/phil-opp) [Rust kernel tutorial](https://os.phil-opp.com/) again.
